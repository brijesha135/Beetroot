##Docker Exploration (Brownie Points)
1.What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers provide a lightweight, portable, and consistent environment for running applications across different systems. Docker simplifies the process of packaging applications and their dependencies into containers, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in various environments.

2.Utilization in This Project
In this project, Docker is utilized to containerize the Contact List API application along with its dependencies. By containerizing the application, it becomes easier to ensure consistency in deployment across different environments. Docker allows developers to define the application environment in a Dockerfile and package it into a Docker image. This image can then be deployed and run as a container on any system that has Docker installed. Docker also facilitates scalability, resource isolation, and simplified deployment processes, making it an ideal choice for hosting and managing web applications.
